                <h5>Disclaimers and Other Nonsense</h5>

                <p>
                    This publication is intended as a useful quick-start guide for front-end developers delving into the realm of Sharepoint development. As such, a few assumptions will be made about you throughout the book:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You’re a front-end developer (I know, I know) with a moderate to advanced level of understanding and experience with HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as common web toolkits/frameworks and technologies (text editors/IDEs, jQuery, AJAX, web servers; you get the drift)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You’re at least somewhat familiar with the Microsoft stack, including Windows, IIS, .NET, and the Visual Studio IDE
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You have immediate access to a back-end .NET developer friend, acquaintance, or coworker who may be able to answer your myriad of stupid questions
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You have a formidable anger management problem
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You’re alright with the author of this book being rather foul-mouthed and temperamental
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    If any of these assumptions are falsy in nature with regards to your person, you may consider putting this book down and attempting to remedy them. “But how?” you ask. I don’t fucking know. I’m just the author, okay?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Otherwise, I hope you find this guide useful as it assists you along the path to Total Sharepoint Enlightenment™.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As one could reasonably assume, though the information contained herein should be largely accurate and trustworthy, it is by no means comprehensive, and various aspects of front-end development for Sharepoint could very well be omitted. If you do happen to stumble across any information in this book that you feel should be corrected post-haste, please don’t hesitate to email me:
                </p>

                <div class="centered">
                    <a href="mailto:jkymarsh@gmail.com">jkymarsh@gmail.com</a>
                </div>

                <p>
                    I will thusly research the correction in question, and assuming it passes my rigorous, time-tested set of qualifications (read: “me lazily Googling for a few minutes”), I will amend this book and credit you somewhere in kind. Thanks in advance.
                </p>

                        If you’re reading this book, it can logically be assumed that you’ve been tasked with completing a project that involves working with Sharepoint; in fact, it’s probably safe to make the assumption that you’re a front-end developer who stumbled upon this text after hysterically Googling “MICROSOFT SHAREPOINT SOME1 PLS HELP,” tears streaming down your pudgy cheeks, fat fists wildly bashing the keyboard of your MacBook Pro.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All is not lost, my friend. I found myself in exactly the same position some time ago; well, aside from the crying, anyway. What are you, some kind of wuss? Christ.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The fact of the matter is that up-to-date, clear-cut information on front-end development for Sharepoint is frighteningly difficult to find. Sharepoint itself is chock-full of bad practices and front-end code taboos that will leave you scratching your head (and potentially crying, since you’ve apparently shown a propensity for doing that, Nancy).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, Sharepoint’s default front-end code (that is, the HTML, CSS, and JS that are used by default within a fresh install of Sharepoint) is so horrific that you’ll likely begin immediately assessing how to rewrite or overhaul the existing code in a desperate attempt to bring it in line with modern web development standards.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Don’t panic. I’m here to help.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This quick-start guide was written to assist you, the mid- to senior-level front-end developer, better understand how Sharepoint is constructed, what its weak points are, and how to develop for it more intelligently and more quickly. We’ll also walk through common vocabulary used during Sharepoint development. Hell, I’ll even be so kind as to give you a whole truckload of tips and tricks for developing in a more agile manner, and with considerably less mind-numbing agony.
                    </p>

                        I’m a really, really nice guy.

                        First things first, let’s have a short Q-and-A session to clear a few things up:

                            Sharepoint 2010. Certain sections may also apply to previous versions, but this is merely coincidence; this book was written as a direct result of working on an extensive Sharepoint 2010 project.

                        <dt>
                            Do the certain circles of hell correspond to particular aspects of Sharepoint development in some meaningful manner?

                    <h5>What is Sharepoint?</h5>

                    <p>
                        This question stands alongside many of life’s most fundamental questions: what makes the sky blue? Where do babies come from? What is love? The answer to all of these questions is “Sharepoint.” Look, I’m not a scientist. I couldn’t possibly be, anyway; I’m here attempting to assist you, while those motherfuckers lyin’ and gettin’ you pissed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sharepoint is a web application platform developed by Microsoft.<sup><a href="#footnote-01-ft" id="footnote-01-pl">1</a></sup> Though you’ll find a wide array of explanations as to what Sharepoint is, it could most accurately be described as “a terrifying, monolithic CMS on crack.” It’s most often used as an intranet site for businesses of all shapes and sizes, offering a range of features:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Document management and collaboration</li>
                        <li>Company- or group-wide wiki pages</li>
                        <li>Large content libraries</li>
                        <li>Sub-sites and communities within an organization</li>
                        <li>Extensive built-in search functionality</li>
                        <li>Individual personal profile pages and social networking capabilities</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Microsoft’s tagline for Sharepoint is “Microsoft SharePoint 2010 makes it easier for people to work together.”<sup><a href="#footnote-02-ft" id="footnote-02-pl">2</a></sup> Conversely, my personal tagline for Sharepoint is the soothing sound of me violently smashing my laptop with a cinder block while my head rotates three-hundred-and-sixty degrees and blood spouts from my eyes. I don’t think I’ll be getting hired by Microsoft’s marketing department any time soon, and I should probably see a doctor.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Though a Sharepoint site or application can be used as either an internet or intranet site, it’s most common for businesses to use it as an intranet portal, allowing employees to communicate with one another and collaborate on documents and wiki pages. It’s not as useful when used as an internet site, due to many of its features being geared towards document sharing and collaboration.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you’re familiar with web development using any other CMS or collaborative web application platform, such as Wordpress, Drupal, Umbraco, DotNetNuke, Magento, and so on, you’ll be able to grasp Sharepoint conceptually without too much difficulty. However, given its sheer size and complexity, Sharepoint poses a rather interesting set of problems and barriers when it comes to both development and use.

                <section>
                    <h5>Technical Details</h5>

                    <p>
                        As mentioned, Sharepoint is a web application platform developed by Microsoft. As one could reasonably presume, this means that Sharepoint runs on the Microsoft stack; that is, the tech stack comprised of the following components:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Microsoft Windows Server 2008 (64-bit)</li>
                        <li>ASP.NET (3.5, to be exact)</li>
                        <li>IIS (7.0 or greater)</li>
                        <li>Microsoft SQL Server 2008</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Older versions of some parts of this stack may also be supported, as well as SQL Server Express, but the above list tends to be the most common configuration.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, browser support tends to be a little spotty. Corporations tend to be the most common adopters of Sharepoint, and as many of these organizations explicitly utilize Windows machines, it can be assumed that Internet Explorer will generally be the most common browser used to access the Sharepoint site. As far as browser support goes:<sup><a href="#footnote-03-ft" id="footnote-03-pl">3</a></sup>
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Internet Explorer 7 and 8 are fully supported (sans caveats to be mentioned later)</li>
                        <li>Internet Explorer 6 is not supported</li>
                        <li>Internet Explorer 9 must be used in compatibility mode</li>
                        <li>Firefox, Chrome, and Safari are all currently supported</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        As a general rule, your site must look great and function perfectly in IE7/8. Companies often approve Sharepoint projects with the assumption that all of their employees will access the site using IE, and as such, modern browsers take a backseat to IE as far as prioritizing a finished, polished site goes. Given appropriate time, support for modern browsers should of course be a priority as well, but IE support should top the list. Additionally, should you require troubleshooting by Microsoft themselves for any reason (in particular, if you’re using Sharepoint Online), they’ll expect you to be using IE throughout the troubleshooting process. It’s a necessary evil.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sharepoint is available in three separate versions: Sharepoint Foundation, Sharepoint Standard, and Sharepoint Enterprise. In true Microsoft fashion, each successive version provides more capability than the last, adding new features and additional integration with other Microsoft products. Sharepoint Foundation is free, while both Standard and Enterprise possess the ability to make your wallet shriek in terror.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A Sharepoint site or application is comprised of a handful of components:<sup><a href="#footnote-04-ft" id="footnote-04-pl">4</a></sup>
                    </p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>Lists,</dt>
                        <dd>
                            which are collections of pieces of information. These could be lists of web links, news articles, users, or anything else you might logically find in a database or datastore
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Libraries,</dt>
                        <dd>
                            which are similar to lists in nature, but can also contain files that can be opened directly in Windows or Microsoft Office applications
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Web parts,</dt>
                        <dd>
                            which are UI widgets that can be added to and removed from pages
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Pages,</dt>
                        <dd>
                            which can take the form of wiki pages, publishing pages, or web part pages
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Sites,</dt>
                        <dd>
                            which are collections of pages, lists, and/or libraries
                        </dd>

                        <dt>Search sites,</dt>
                        <dd>
                            which are sites that allow access to Sharepoint’s search engine in order to find content or users
                        </dd>
                    </dl>

                    <p>
                        A typical Sharepoint application may contain many sites and/or search sites, which may in turn contain many sub-sites. It can all become quite a behemoth, as you can likely imagine. Add to this the fact that users of the Sharepoint application may be able to create their own sub-sites, and you begin to see just how enormous the sheer scope of a Sharepoint application could become, especially for a larger corporation with thousands of employees.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In general, a single Sharepoint site (of which there could be many within the whole application, remember) is composited in the following manner:
                    </p>

                    <div class="centered">
                        <span>List/Library > Web Part > Page > Site/Sub-site</span>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        That is, a list/library full of data is fed into a web part, which displays that data on a page, which is a portion of an overall site or sub-site. Phew!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you’ll recall, I mentioned that Sharepoint does bear some similarities to other CMSes you might be familiar with; for example, you’ve probably grasped that this flow of information is pretty similar to the way a CMS like Wordpress would display data via a widget that you’ve placed on the page. If it weren’t for Microsoft having some insatiable urge to give things convoluted names like “web part” and “list/library” instead of “widget” and “database/datastore,” you probably would have grasped that even more quickly. Thanks for nothing, Microsoft. Unfortunately, you’ll find that’s a recurring trend within Sharepoint; Microsoft loves to rename things that are already commonly-understood within the web development community. Don’t worry, there’s a glossary coming up to address just that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Okay, okay, so they’re not ALWAYS totally in the wrong. Technically, lists and libraries don’t have the same capabilities as databases, despite their contents being stored via SQL Server. Their capabilities and differences are a bit outside the scope of this book, but if you’re interested, you can find more information here:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In an extremely general sense, that’s a brief overview of Sharepoint and how a Sharepoint application or intranet site would be constructed. We’ll expand more upon the organization of both the front- and back-ends shortly, but if you’re looking for an in-depth technical overview of how Sharepoint interfaces with IIS and/or SQL Server, you may want to do some outside research at this point.

                    <h5>Glossary</h5>

                    <p>
                        Deep in the bowels of hellfire and desperation that comprise Sharepoint, things are not always what they seem. Terminology that was once wholly familiar to you in an average web development environment may have a completely different meaning amongst the Microsoft stack. Even worse, there’s a smattering of new vocabulary that you’ve likely never heard before, especially if you’re coming from a background in another tech stack. Understanding the lingo of Sharepoint development is a huge part of being able to communicate with the back-end devs, so let’s take a look at a list of some of the terms you might come across.

                        It should be noted that this is only a partial list of Sharepoint terms; realistically, there are dozens, or even hundreds, of unfamiliar terms you might hear when working on a Sharepoint project. In my experience, these are some of the most common terms used on an everyday basis. For a more complete selection of Sharepoint terminology, I highly recommend scouring the following resources:

                            In the context of Sharepoint, developers who refer to “AJAX” are likely referring to ASP.NET AJAX, a .NET library built to allow .NET developers to more easily integrate asynchronous calls into their web applications. Often, when you explain to .NET developers that “AJAX” simply describes a technique for building asynchronous web applications, they’ll look at you weird, only having been exposed to the .NET library. Resist your urge to punch them and call them mean names.

                        Again, this is by no means a comprehensive list of all Sharepoint terminology you may encounter on any given project. Instead, this is a “crash course-”esque look at a slew of terms you may run into, due to their sheer pervasiveness across many different types of Sharepoint projects. Hopefully this list has cleared up some confusion for you, and will reduce the number of blank stares you give back-end developers when they toss around terms like “hive” and “provisioning.”

                <section>
                    <h5>Front-end Structure</h5>

                    <p>
                        Structurally, Sharepoint is probably fairly similar to other CMSes you’ve used in the past: content is drawn from some sort of database and fed to the front-end, and may be displayed with widgets, page sections, or other page elements. In Sharepoint’s case, the content will be coming from a list or library, and will generally be presented via a web part.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        User-facing pages may also consist of wiki pages or publishing pages, which may or may not contain web parts and web part zones. These pages could be used to display content such as news articles, user profiles, wiki articles (duh), and so on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, all system and administrative pages will pass through your front-end as well. Sharepoint’s dizzying array of system pages can make use of your master page(s), meaning you’re able to brand the back-end of your Sharepoint site in addition to the user-facing front-end, if you’re some kind of masochist.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Sharepoint is based on the ASP.NET Web Forms programming model. This means that the pages that comprise the front-end of a Sharepoint site are created using an amalgamation of HTML, server controls, and server code. When users request a page, the server controls and code are compiled and executed, producing a page full of hideous rendered HTML.<sup><a href="#footnote-05-ft" id="footnote-05-pl">5</a></sup> If you’re familiar with .NET web development, Sharepoint’s development model will be familiar to you, if you have any experience using the Web Forms model.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, the Web Forms programming model is considered outdated these days, and has been superceded by a programming model known as ASP.NET MVC. The Web Forms model was highly criticized for producing ugly spaghetti code, which was a result of server controls and code being directly intermingled with HTML on front-end pages. Think back into the distant past, when you wrote HTML forms by writing PHP directly in .php page files, tossing PHP code into HTML tag attributes without a care. Remember how horrible that was? Yeah, Sharepoint still uses that programming model.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As of the time of this book’s writing, Sharepoint still does not utilize an MVC programming model, and Microsoft has no imminent plans to convert it as such. There are workarounds to be able to use the wonderful Razor view engine in tandem with Sharepoint, as well as what’s referred to as an “MVP” (Model View Presenter) programming model, but you’re on your own with those things. Happy Googling.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What does Sharepoint’s old-school programming model and structure mean for you, my valiant front-end developer? Well, primarily that your HTML files are going to exhibit a few key traits:

                            &#60;asp:ContentPlaceHolder id="PlaceHolderBodyAreaClass" runat="server" />
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They may contain inline CSS
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They may contain inline JS
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Yeah, it’s not a particularly pretty situation. The fact that Sharepoint’s default master page, v4.master, is over 600 lines long is a pretty decent indicator that the code bloat’s attending this party in full force. Additionally, Sharepoint’s default CSS file, corev4.css, clocks in at a monolithic 7400 lines of code. It’s probably best that you not even look at these files yourself right now; save the trauma for later.

                        We’ll get into the good, bad, and ugly of Sharepoint’s front-end in upcoming chapters, but for now, that’s a pretty decent rundown of what you’ll be looking at on an average Sharepoint project. Lots of code. A whole shitload of code. Most of it terrifying.

                        “Yeah, yeah, whatever!” you shout obnoxiously, rudely interrupting my poignant critique of Sharepoint’s front-end. “But what about the back-end?!” Well, you’re sort of out of luck there. Admittedly, I don’t know much about how Sharepoint’s back-end actually functions.

                        Luckily, Stack Overflow is here to help. After a concise search query, here are some of my personal favorite user-submitted results after asking “How does Sharepoint work?”
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>“Occasionally.”</li>
                        <li>“On Error Resume Next.”</li>
                        <li>“Sharepoint itself is written in a unique syntax, made entirely from ‘Unexpected Error’ exceptions.”</li>
                        <li>“Automagically.”</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Jokes aside, the “Technical Details” portion of this chapter was probably the most elaborate rundown of Sharepoint’s back-end that you’ll find within this book. Assuming you have a knowledgeable .NET developer on your team, they likely have a more in-depth understanding of how Sharepoint actually operates. Probe them. Not literally, you deviant.
